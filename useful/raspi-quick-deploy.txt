Use a USB drive for booting the raspi - raspi 4 will boot of USB by default

- Burn a standard raspios latest disto onto USB with balenea etcher
- Before booting make these changes in the /boot partition

touch ssh

edit /boot/cmdline.txt and add
  " cgroup_memory=1 cgroup_enable=memory"
to the end of the command line

edit /boot/config.txt and add these lines:
    dtoverlay=disable-wifi
    dtoverlay=disable-bt

- Boot from USB and find out the IP, then ssh to the pi with user pi pass raspberry.
- Maybe create a new user and delete pi if you are paranoid.

- sudo raspi-config
change these:
  set hostname, password and boot/autologin (boot to cmdline and no autologin)
  set Performance/GPU Memory to 16GB (the minimum)
- sudo apt update
- sudo apt full-upgrade
  (this may take a while)

- sudo shutdown now

- Put the USB key back in your desktop and make a image copy:
- lsblk
  look for the drive with /boot and /rootfs - that i the drive to image e.g. /dev/sdd
- sudo dd if=/dev/sdd bs=1024 conv=sparse count=10M | gzip > 2021-05-rpi1-tiny4.zip

This image 2021-05-rpi1-tiny4.zip can be used to quickly burn a copy, to use the new
copy:
- use a disks utility to expand the rootfs partition to fill the new USB drive
- boot in a pi and change the hostname if necessary
